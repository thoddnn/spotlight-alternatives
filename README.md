# Alternatives to Spotlight on macOS

Spotlight is built into macOS and works fine for quick app launches or system lookups.  
But many people find it limiting when they need more: searching inside long PDFs, finding text in images, jumping to a slide or timestamp, or working with sensitive files privately.  

This page collects popular Spotlight alternatives for macOS, from simple file search tools to full productivity launchers.
